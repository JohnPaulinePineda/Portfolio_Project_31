# **1. Table of Contents**
|
| This document presents a non-exhaustive list of sample size and power calculations for clinical research mean comparison tests using various helpful packages in <mark style="background-color: #CCECFF">**R**</mark>. 
|
| Mean comparison tests applied during clinical research refer to trials evaluated in terms of mean responses of some primary study endpoints. The objectives of the intended clinical trials usually include the evaluation of intervention effects, demonstration of therapeutic equivalence or non-inferiority and establishment of superiority. The equations applied in this study (mostly contained in the <mark style="background-color: #CCECFF">**base**</mark> package) attempt to provide calculations for the sample size, critical value and power based on the study objectives and hypotheses of interest.

##  1.1 One-Sample Design
|
| [One-Sample Design](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.1201/9781315183084/sample-size-calculations-clinical-research-shein-chung-chow-jun-shao-hansheng-wang-yuliya-lokhnygina) involves individual numeric response values from sampled subjects. In clinical research, responses could be the difference between matched pairs such as the pre-treatment and post-treatment responses or changes from baseline to endpoint within a treatment group. Responses are assumed to be independent and identically distributed normal random variables with zero mean and a given variance. Parameters needed for the computations are as follows:
|
| **[A]** <span style="color: #FF0000">Mean Response</span> : True mean response value obtained from sampled subjects 
|
| **[B]** <span style="color: #FF0000">Reference</span> : Baseline value for comparison
|
| **[C]** <span style="color: #FF0000">Standard Deviation</span> : Data variability based from literature, pilot studies or preliminary experiments
|
| **[D]** <span style="color: #FF0000">Alpha</span> : Maximum allowed Type I error
|
| **[E]** <span style="color: #FF0000">Beta</span> : Maximum allowed Type II error
|
| **[F]** <span style="color: #FF0000">Testing Margin</span> : 
|      **[F.1]** Minimum margin to establish that the mean response is much better than reference
|      **[F.2]** Minimum margin to establish that the mean response is not much worse as the reference
|      **[F.3]** Minimum margin to establish that the mean response is no better and no worse than the reference
